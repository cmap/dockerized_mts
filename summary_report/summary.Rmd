# Data {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

## Overview

The goal of this report is to provide a broad level overview of both compound and cell line behavior across MTS/CPS screens. <br>
Necessary data includes Level 4, Level 5, and QC data.  <br>
**Unique Conditions (compound, culture, pert plate) Tested**: `r n_conditions`  <br>
**Unique Compounds Tested: `r n_compounds`** <br>
**Total Cell Lines (Which Pass QC):** `r n_cell_lines` <br>



## Summary Table

1) Cell Lines Killed is defined as a cell line which has < **0.3** viability to any compound dose 
2) Mean Replicate Correlation is the average Replicate correlations for X1/X2, X2/X3, and X1/X3. <br>
3) Monotonicity is assessed by looking at the difference in viability between two incremental (lower and higher) doses: Change in Viability = Viability of Higher Dose - Viability of Lower Dose. 
If change in viability is > **0.25**, the upper dose is flagged. 
4) Uncorrelated Killing Score is an index from 0-1 designed to flag killing in which there is little correlation across replicates (possible false positivites) and is defined as: \[ \text{Uncorrelated Killing Score} = \left( \frac{\text{Cell Lines Killed}}{\text{Total Cell Lines}} \right) \times \left(1 - \text{Mean Replicate Correlation} \right) \]

## Monotonicity Table By Cell Line 

Monotonicity is assessed by looking at the difference in viability between two incremental (lower and higher) doses: Change in Viability = Viability of Higher Dose - Viability of Lower Dose. 
If change in viability is > **0.25**, the upper dose is flagged. 


```{r monotonic cell line table, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}

# Monotonicity table by cell lines 
DT::datatable(monotonicity_by_lines,
              filter = "top", rownames = F,
              colnames = c("Cell Line", "Number of Non-Monotonic Occurrences"),
              options = list(dom = "tp"))



```


## Monotonicity Table By Compound and Dose 

Monotonicity is assessed by looking at the difference in viability between two incremental (lower and higher) doses: Change in Viability = Viability of Higher Dose - Viability of Lower Dose. 
If change in viability is > **0.25**, the upper dose is flagged. 


```{r monotonic compound dose table, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}

# Monotonicity by compound dose condition 
DT::datatable(monotonicity_compound_dose,
              filter = "top", rownames = F,
              colnames = c("Project", "Compound ID", "Compound Name", "Dose", "Culture", "Pert Plate", "Number of Non-Monotonic Occurrences"),
              options = list(dom = "tp"))



```







## Inert Table 

Inert cell lines are cell lines which have a viability > **0.9** to the maximum dose of a compound. 


```{r inert table, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}

# Inert table 
DT::datatable(inert_by_lines,
              filter = "top", rownames = F,
              colnames = c("Cell Line", "Compounds Which Were Inert To Cell Line"),
              options = list(dom = "tp"))



```
